Built with hybrid AI architecture combining **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)** for strategic decisions and **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** for real-time combat optimization. This project is planned to push the boundaries of AI in gaming, enabling the bot to adapt, learn, and improve its performance over time without any prior knowledge of the game. |
